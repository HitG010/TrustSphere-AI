Very good skin softener.', \"Great scent, This is my best friend's signature scent, he's been wearing it for years. Got this for him for Valentine's Day, great purchase.\", \"Invigorating and fragrant, I love the zingy, fragrant scent of the shampoo. It feels relatively unisex, and doesn't leave a lot of fragrance lingering behind after you rinse it out. I followed up with a peppermint conditioner from the natural food store, and really enjoyed the lovely cooling summer pick me up for my hair.<br /><br />The shampoo is not overly stripping, but definitely leans more towards really getting things clean rather than being overly moisturizing. I found that I could use it about three times a week on my long hair, and then needed to do co-washing or something more moisturizing in between. I really like the shampoo and appreciate having something more herbal like this in my regimen.\", 'This is my go to hairspray, I have realities issues so scent is a factor to me and there is no scent or low scent making it my go to. Holds very well unless you are in a Hurricane', \"really liked that the product didn't have greasy or heavy feel ..., Starters, I LOOOOOOOOVE tea tree scent, strong, but not overpowering or nasty in synthetic way.  As conditioner, really liked that the product didn't have greasy or heavy feel as I applied it to my hair.  Nice smoothness after drying, liked the feel,of my hair, but no major fragrance afterwards, which I like.  Treats my scalp in good condition too.\", 'Nice light smell, Light nice smell. Better than the perfume', 'The best, Fabulous scent my absolute favorite body wash', 'Hair perfume, I love this stuff.  Perfect scent-  light!  Will buy more', 'FANTASTIC SCENT & LOVING THE SHINY HAIR, I have very dull and lifeless hair, I think it is from too much sun and abuse growing up My hair is light weight but very frizzy so I have to use straighteners or curling irons to have it look decent. This has definitely made my hair shiny and looking great. I just sprayed it on damp hair, I combed it through and then I used a flat iron and I have also used it with the curling iron and I loved the outcome. My hair definitely had alot more life to it. I think if your hair looks good you feel good about yourself. The smell of this spray is amazing, it is like a fresh melon scent. It is super easy to use and I love that it gives my hair a layer of protection from the heated hair appliances and the sun. It is for all hair types and it is very light weight.', 'Not overpowering, Smells good without being overpowering.', \"Great scent, very light weight, very runny., I love the scent. Not too strong, not offensive in a crowd. I just wish that it was a thicker formula. This lotion is really runny, and I don't find it very moisturizing. I find that I need to reapply with every single hand washing.\", \"Helps Hair Look Healthier, this leave in conditioner is easy to use. sprayed on damp hair, it is an effective detangler. sprayed on both dry and damp hair, it does provide some softness and moisture to dry, over processed hair. My hair is fine and color treated and is frequently subjected to heat from dryers and curling irons. This did leave it feeling soft and looking healthy. However it didn't do much to refresh my style and the fragrance is strong. It is not an unpleasant aroma, sweet like baby powder and light musk, but not my favorite. It is strong and it lasts all day. The bottle tucks easily into a bag or briefcase and the spray functions smoothly. I wish it either had a difference scent or was fragrance free. I appreciate the exclusion of mineral oil, petrolaltum or artificial coloring. It is an effective product that provides relief to stressed locks.\", \"Over scented, I like the texture and application of this moisturizer. It soaks in well and left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. However, it is way over scented for my preference. The scent is nice, but just too strong and doesn't fade for quite awhile.\", 'Best Spray, The best for my hair!', 'Strong scent but works great, Really happy with this concentrate. I did not expect it to work well but am very thankful to be wrong. It thickens to the normal consistency of conditioners after it cools. It’s very moisturizing for my thick curly hair. My only issue was the scent. Very strong herbal scent. It was not really my thing but a little added essential oil was all it needed. However, in the future I’ll just order the unscented and add my own scent', 'Smells Great and Leaves Skin Soft!, I love this!  Smells great, and not too overpowering at all!', 'Smells amazing, This smells great and works great as well. I have dark hair and have found that if I spray it in all the places that I need to, leave it alone for over 5 mins. Like the directions say to, that it works perfectly without flakes. Most importantly I only used it at night and sleep on it.', \"smells great, This shampoo feels so light and smells so good. I have very fine hair and when I use it with the blowdryer or a heated straightener it produces a lot of body. I'm also please with how it makes my scalp feel. It's almost like a mint/menthol type of feeling but there is not a mediciney smell like other &#34;therapeutic&#34; shampoos. I received this shampoo at a discount for an honest review.\", \"Excellent in All Areas, This is a very unique and effective product.<br /><br />Used with a light pre-styler on medium-length hair:<br /><br />Scent: It's a light scent. Warm and slightly spiced. Very pleasant and masculine.<br />Consistency: Extremely creamy. Becomes slightly tacky when emulsifying.<br />Styling: Smooth through the hair at first, with increasing tug the more you style. This is not a problem for me and is part of getting great hold from a product.<br />Finish: Slightly shiny at first, but becomes much more matte as it dries in the hair.<br />Hold: Legitimate all-day hold without becoming too rigid to restyle.<br /><br />This is one of my new favorites. Seriously good in all areas, which is so rare. TheSalonGuy has a real winner with this one.\", 'Great soft fragrance❤️, Super light fragrance.... very professional fragrance...

They arrived so fast. Happy day!! This is one of the reasons i love Amazon. Thank you.', 'No over powering scent. Holds hair well in all weather, Holds hair well in all weather not sticky and does not have overpowering scent', \"Such a nice spray mist, This spray smells amazing, it does claim to be completely natural so I am wondering if it really is since the smell is very well... processed in my opinion, that being said, it does look completely natural it's completely transparent and once you apply it it doesn't feel as sticky as other products I've used before it really gives the hair a very natural look and for having just applied it a few minutes ago my hair feels extremely soft to the touch which gives me a pretty good idea that this is a good hair spray. The presentation is really pretty and looks cute and clean as well. I love it! I just hope it works well in the long run! The only problem I had (completely unrelated to the spray itself) is that they left it at my neighbors door instead.\", 'Smells very nice, but pricey, Smells nice...but very expensive. My bottle arrived with about 20% of the product “missing” due to leakage (plastic wrap was wet).  It has a very pleasant scent, but the price is really too high for the small amount. I wanted to try this out before deciding wether  to purchase a bigger bottle. The bigger bottle is a better value for the money, but the product did not make much of a difference in my hair and the smell disappeared right away.... so I will not repurchase.', 'like it, Smells like oranges.  I like the smell.  I have fine curly hair.  I only need a small pea sized drop to apply in my hair.  Really helps the curl and frizz.', 'Great Fragrance, This is a winner.  The fragrance is soft and exactly what I was looking for . Will buy again.', 'Smells amazing, This body wash smells SO good. The sandalwood really comes through but it isn’t overpowering.

Secret Original Shower Fresh Scent is a great value.', \"Fantasy Girl For Women, Eau De Parfum 2.9 Fl. Oz., [[ASIN:B01ETY733E Fantasy Girl For Women, Eau De Parfum 2.9 Fl. Oz. / 85 ml - Inspired By Pink Friday By Nicki Minaj Perfume]]<br /><br />I have been trying several different parfums and body sprays to help me find a new fresh scent or to come up with my own signature scent by combining two or three scents or wearing one scent alone. The seller does a fabulous job of packaging and delivering quickly. The parfum is very pretty in it's design in a feminine bottle with a curved feminine design that's cute on my dresser or vanity. I like this parfum. It has a sort of delicious smelling fruity scent that is very inviting, but you can also smell musk and a slight hint of sweet floral undertones like jasmine. The scent is nice and soft and doesn't bother or irritate my senses. The scent is not overpowering. It's super difficult to explain how scents smell but all I can say is it really does smell fantastic and it does stay on for a pretty good while. I like how the scent sort of softens and mellows when I wear it a while. It lasts a lot longer if I spray it on my wrist and other pulse points and lingers in the air. I definitely like this parfum and would absolutely say try it for yourself. It's a pretty sensual scent and my finance likes it. This is a 2.9 ounce bottle at under 11.00 delivered to your door. I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. The discount I received will not alter my honest opinion in any way. Since I count on honest product reviews to make my selections on Amazon, I will always be forthcoming and sincere in all my reviews. No matter if the product is discounted or not, I will leave honest feedback that I base on my own personal experience with the product I receive. I am in no way affiliated with any supplier or manufacturer of goods. *One last note, I wasn't sure what the difference in Eau De Parfum and Perfume is, so I looked it up. Here's what I found on the web on perfume website: Eau de parfum. &#34;After the top notes have died away, the middle notes or heart notes of a perfume become noticeable. This is the focus of eau de parfum which makes it perfect to spray on hair or clothing. (Be careful with delicate fabrics such as silk, though, as they may stain.) The concentration of oils is over 15%, sometimes reaching as high as 20%. Since it is less intense than perfume extract, it is also cheaper, but it usually lasts well and is sold in small sizes.&#34; So it is stronger than Eau de Cologne which contains about 7% essence dissolved in alcohol of 60º or 70º, and stronger than Eau de toilette which contains around 10% aromatic essence. But not as strong as Perfume. This is the strongest of scents because of the higher concentration of essences – as much as 40% by volume.\", 'Excellent product, The scent is really good and it does an excellent job of making me feel clean after a long day at work and sweaty.', 'Love Smell!, This is very gentle and makes my skin feel so smooth!', 'Very Nice!, What a soothing and wonderful lavender smell this lotion has. It goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all. Moisturizes nicely, yet is not heavy. I find the fragrance very relaxing, with a natural lavender smell. I am enjoying using this product.', \"I love love love this product, I love love love this product. It smells delicious and fresh. It is a light scent so it isn't over powering at all. The bottle is nice and big and my guests that come over love it. Highly recommend this lotion.<br /><br />It is very moisturising and leaves you feeling hydrated and not greasy at all\", \"Great product, but maybe a different scent., This particular scent isn't something I'm in love with. It smells good, just not for me. I'm using it anyway and it's doing great for my dry skin and beard texture. So far it's about two months and there's still plenty left, and that's with not quite a full beard.<br /><br />I'll be getting a different scent but the product itself is great.\", 'Wonderful smell!, Bought this for my Ex. Smells amazing and the packaging is very cool as well. I think you can almost never go wrong with a Viktor and Rolf cologne! If you like this try Spicebomb!', 'Wonderful scent and great deodorant, I love this product.  I have several scents, and this is the lightest.  They all work very well for me, no caking, no white residue on my skin or tops, and no odor no matter how hot it is or how active I am.  Note, though, it’s not really an anti-prespirant.  I’m not a sweaty person, so this is perfect for me.  If you do perspire a lot, you might need to give this a pass.', '3 stars, This perfume smells really good and I love the presentation of it. However, after about 15 minutes... you can’t smell it at all... if you can keep spraying it then it would be great.', 'Smooth finish, so-so smell, The very light smell of this is not that bad,  but there’s something kind of weird that lingers, like a weird chemical odor. I mean, everything is chemicals, but I mean it doesn’t smell like any particular oil or plant or herb or spice. It smells kind of plasticky? It absorbs nicely and offers a smooth finish, but I’m just not quite sure how I feel about the fragrance. It’s not bad, and it’s light, so I guess it’s fine. Not the best, not the worst.', 'great wig spray, smells good! A little goes a long way and it is affordable', \"Not an attractive scent at all, If you are looking for a scented beard balm then this ain't the one. Not an attractive scent at all for the price. Two thumbs down!\", \"OK for a dry shampoo, but scent is overpowering, Smells like a grandma's powder room. I really can't get past how strong the fragrance is. Is it really necessary? Other than that, I like that it isn't an aerosol. I will probably just save this for when I go camping. I don't think I can tolerate the intense odor for even occasional use at home.\", \"Smells Great and Helps Tame Big hair, I received my new Argan Oil shampoo and was super excited to start using it. I have thick natural, healthy, unprocessed shoulder length hair. What I noticed with this shampoo was first of all it took a lot of shampoo the first time I washed it (one of two times) to get my hair to lather. Since this is organic I was not surprise to find this, but disappointed that it seemed to take so much shampoo. My fix the second time I washed my hair was to use a different shampoo for the &#34;starter wash&#34; and to use the Argan oil for the final wash. I LOVE how the shampoo smells and how it looks when I've finished blow drying and styling my hair. My hair is quite thick and can get kind of frizzy and have fly aways which did not happen with this shampoo. Typically I cannot wash my hair everyday, as it usually takes a couple days for my hair to &#34;fall&#34; and not look so &#34;big&#34;. Fortunately, my hair looked great immediately with this new shampoo. I also washed my hair before a house party for New Years and had MANY compliments from various family members over the wonderful smell of my shampoo. Several requests were made by my mom, sister, sister in law and niece to tell them the name of my shampoo. It has a fresh spa like scent and appears to be a cross between a bit of honey and vanilla in the fragrance. I LOVE this shampoo and was very excited to have the opportunity to review this product for my unbiased opinion.\", \"Great perfume alternative, I love body oils right out of the shower and this light scent doesn't disappoint\", \"Nice scent, I'm not big on fragrances especially artificial,  perfumey stuff.  This has a nice clean scent that compliments my natural smell.  It keeps me dry and comfy even on very hot days.\", \"A Must for Date Night, Love the way this balm and conditioner is fragranced. If you like oud, with it's mysteriously sensual scent of woodsy incense, this is for you.<br />The jar looks uniquely elegant.<br />Although it's a solid balm, it melts easily in your hands. In shipping, it looks like it seperated a bit, right down to staining the presentation box.<br />While that might be an issue if giving as a gift, it does not affect the quality or use.<br />A little goes a long way, and that amazing scent stays on a good while.\", \"Great scent, Lovely scent, and the bottle is HUGE!! I bought this for my boyfriend and he's over the moon, haha.\", 'This is special!, It feels absolutely delightful, is silky moisturizing and has a great, subtle scent.', \"Great scents, I am a repeat customer of these body sprays. They come in a nice big bottle too.  I purchased all four of the scents and I think I'd have to say the tropical tease is my favorite.  All of the scents are very nice though, soft, feminine and smell great.  Several people have complemented me on how great I smell and so I will continue to use them.  My boyfriend likes them too. I am enjoying them very much.\", 'Love this!, I bought this to try it because I didn’t wanna buy the bigger bottle until I knew that I liked it. Smells amazing!! Hints of pear and vanilla and it lasts a long time. I’ve gotten lots of compliments.', 'Recommend!!, I love the scent that leaves on my hair!! And my hair has never looked better! Will be buying more!! Thank you!!', 'Smells nice, Not for my type of hair & scalp. I have curvy, thin, low porosity, bleach damaged hair & most moisturizing conditioners leave a heavy build up on my scalp & make my hair limp. That is exactly what happened with this mask too. The scent is light & kind of melon smelling & it spreads easily, but other than those 2 things, I did not like it.', \"Extremely happy with this, This serum is so very very good! Smells warm and woodsy in a way, not floral or soapy. Very viscous, medium-heavy. The dropper only dispenses about 4 drops, which is enough for face and neck. I use a roller after applying too, which I highly recommend. I'm happy with the glow and hydration my skin has. The longer I use it, the better my skin looks.\", \"Excellent performance; enjoyable scent; very little needed per use, I'm very pleased with this face cleaner. It is a medium thick consistency that has a creamy texture. It lathers a bit slowly at first, but builds up a nice, thick lather after a few moments. Not much is needed per use -- just a dab will get the job done. It cleans very well but doesn't leave my face dry. I've had zero irritation from it even though it's a good, deep cleaner.<br /><br />The scent is very enjoyable. It's a light floral/fruity scent that is unique. It is not overpowering, and doesn't linger after rinsing.<br /><br />The tube comes nicely packaged for protection during transit. It's in a reinforced box cardboard box that is shrink wrapped. Even if it's sent in a padded envelope there's very little risk of the tube leaking in transit.<br /><br />No complaints at all. It works very well, has an enjoyable, unique scent, is packaged well, and since so little is needed per use, the value is pretty good. Five stars!\", 'Five Stars, The best hair spray ever!!!', 'Scent is great., The scent is very nice and the liquid-creamy soap is great.', 'Eh. Smells like old lady and made hair frizzy, I was excited to try this but personally found the aroma off-putting, like overpowering old lady perfume.<br />The scent I was willing to overlook if it made my hair healthy.<br />It did not.<br />This product e<br />Made my hair a frizzy mess unfortunately.<br />So sad to leave a bad review but hey, I appreciate blunt honesty, I hope you do too.<br />❤️', \"My son said the smell is awesome!, I bought this for my son as his hair is thinning. I don't know yet how well this is helping . He did say the smell is awesome. He really likes it\", 'I like this stuff. Was a good value., Love the scent!', 'Best Smell, My favorite perfume in the whole wide world. I wish there were more for me to buy. Great smell. I get compliments all the time.', \"The best ogx, This and the conditioner together is my favorite smell and makes my feel the best. I've tried almost every one of the ogx shampoo and conditioners, and while I like them all, I LOVE this one. It's my favorite for sure!\", 'LOVE THIS, This is expensive $$$ but makes me feel like a million when I use it. THe scent is amazingly fresh and perfect. Makes my sking feel great', 'Nice smelling shampoo with mediocre lather, This is a very nice shampoo. You get a huge bottle for just $16 containing argan oil which is great for your hair. I like that this bottle has a pump dispenser which makes it just so much easier to dispense the shampoo in the shower.<br /><br />The shampoo has a very pleasant scent that I like a lot. It produces only a medium lather but it still works quite well to clean your hair. I personally prefer a nice rich lather with my shampoos. It rinses out very easily and leaves you with squeaky clean hair. My hair looked good when I used this and I have no complaints there. All in all this is a very nice inexpensive shampoo containing argan oil which I do like for my hair.', 'Love this., Great smell, works well.  Even got my boyfriend to switch to it.', \"I like the smell and the oil, This is a completely different product than the other oils by the same company. It isn't even the same color or consistency. This one requires two drops to cover your face and décolleté. A little goes a long way.\", 'Wonderful cucumber scent, This is one of the most refreshing moisturizers I have tried, and I really like this one a lot!  It is very creamy and pale green in color, goes on smooth, and has a wonderful cucumber smell, but is much more subtle and not overpowering.  I have very dry skin, so am very happy that this moisturizer applies easily and absorbs into the skin very well.  It definitely makes dry skin look more alive.  Definitely a 5 star moisturizer!', 'Relaxing fragrance!, So relaxing. Every night when I go to bed. Love it.', \"My Favorite Hairspray!, I love this hairspray! I don't like &#34;products&#34; in my hair, like gels, etc. However, this spray holds the style and even when my short hair is brushed, the style/curl retains the style. Great product and good price.\", \"Best Hairspray Ever!, Doesn't stink like other brands and holds my hair on place without looking sticky.\", \"Crisp and Refreshing!, I LOVE Hask hair products. I'm a huge fan and have been for some time. So, I was super excited test Hask's body wash.  But I had a problem right from the start. I had to decide between 4 fantastic choices!  Coconut, Lavender + Vanilla, Cucumber + Aloe and Shea + Cocoa Butter. Since it was very warm outside the day I ordered and with summer rapidly approaching, I chose Cucumber + Aloe.<br /><br />Perfect choice!<br /><br />This is a 2 pack of 24.5oz Hask Cucumber + Aloe Body wash. The scent is delicious- light , crisp and not at all overwhelming. The bottle's pump dispenses easily as well as a  good amount of body wash. It lathers quickly and does a great job of cleansing skin.  I also use it while shaving my legs and it works well.  When I step out of the bathtub my skin feels wonderful and I feel nice and relaxed.  The aloe helps hydrate and moisturize my dry, sensitive skin.<br /><br />The 2 bottles are big in size and will last for quite some time in our home.  That, along with the great results make the price reasonable. Recommended!\", 'Smells amazing!!, Love this product. A little more expensive than in retail store but worth it in saving a trip to town.', 'Good product, Not quite the scent I wanted.', 'Wonderful product, has such a light clean smell, Wonderful product,has such a light clean smell.', 'Purchased as a gift …, My mother in law loves lavender smelling things.<br />I have the rose one and love it, so thought the lavender one would make a nice gift for her.<br />The formula is nice, not sticky, and the smell is not overpowering.<br />This brand has the most affordable products and so far I have enjoyed everything I’ve bought.<br />The packaging is really nice too. Very sturdy and pretty.<br />My mother in law seems to really like it.', 'Smells great and very gentle on the hair, I have three different &#34;flavors&#34; from this brand of shampoo and they all smell good enough to eat.  They are also very easy on you hair, not stripping it dry.  And a little bit of this shampoo goes along way.  I dilute it in some warm water first.  It looks like a small tube for the money but it is worth it being so concentrated.', \"Smells Great!, I use a number of Aubrey products and wanted to try a fragrance I had not seen in the stores.  This is a nice honeysuckle fragrance that is not overpowering - it fades to a fresh, less flowery scent as the day goes on.  With the added benefit of CoQ10, it is a very nice hand and body lotion.  It's a little pricey, but that's because I like it so much I could see myself using a lot of it.\", 'great soap, Overall this is great soap.  It has a good scent but not overwhelming.  The size is a bit larger than what is typically found in stores.  A good buy.', \"Seems good, From my daughter: I like that you can use this product in a variety of ways, when hair is wet as a leave in conditioner, when hair is dry to protect it from heat styling or after it is styled to add shine. I put some on my hair after I straightened it and it seemed to work well to tame frizz and add shine. It has a light scent that isn't overpowering.\", 'Strongly scented, The smell is really strong. Not at all subtle.  It reminds me of scented talcum powders my Grandma used to use, kind of a spicy floral smell.  I personally think it is too strong and would not want to go around smelling that way if I can help it. That said, it works well to decrease the appearance of oily roots and can extend your hair wash by a day for sure, if you can stand the smell.  I will keep it as a backup for when I run out of  the other lighter scented dry shampoos.', \"Musky light fragrance with beautiful bottle, I love this bottle!  It is a gorgeous color and sleek feminine design!  Good job BHPC~ I grabbed this body mist because of the bottle and I instantly liked it.  Light musky, earthy scent.  Not floral at all, or clean or citrus.  If you like more oriental fragrances, as I do you'll like this.  Perfect for anytime.  It's a bit like the way more expensive Jean Paul Gaultier, which I have, wear and love!\", 'Strong scent, Scent is almost overpowering', \"Gorgeous!, Gorgeous scent! Light, fresh, I love it.  I bought this in Paris for 1/3 the price, but when it's time to replace it....\", 'Has a spicy aroma; leaves my hair nourished and enhanced my curls (see update), This shampoo and conditioner travel-size duo (2 ounces each bottle) has a spicy aroma that is neither pleasant nor offensive but not my favorite smell.  The shampoo produces a medium lather and cleans well. The conditioner is creamy and conditions well. When my hair dried, it had a sheen to it and was well nourished and my curls were enhanced.<br /><br />The current price of $14 for this set is expensive. If this had an intoxicating fragrance I liked and was more reasonably priced, I would have loved it. However, this is not a set I would buy at this price.<br /><br />Note that I get about four uses to this set for my short to medium hair.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/22/20 - This only lasted me three uses. However, I had such trouble getting both the remaining shampoo and conditioner (particularly the conditioner) out of the bottle. They need to change this to a squeeze tube. I actually had to fill the bottle with water several times to dislodge the remaining ingredients. Also, the conditioner makes the floor of the shower or tub very slippery (almost as if I put Pledge on a floor).  Based on this, I lowered my ranking from 4 to 2 stars.', \"I wasn't even sure if either one of us would like the smell of this, My husband doesn't wear cologne very often, just mainly when we go out somewhere special, but not on a day to day basis. I wasn't even sure if either one of us would like the smell of this, but for the price I got it for it was worth a shot. I was actually planning on saving it as a stocking stuffer for Christmas time since I start my shopping early for that, but he happened to see it when I was opening the box. It took awhile to be shipped so I forgot I even ordered it or else I wouldn't have opened it in front of him. Oh well. It's a really strong scent. He didn't even take the cap off the bottle and we could really smell it. He says he doesn't mind the scent of it. It's not his favorite but he is willing to wear it and try it out as long as I can handle smelling it. I told him just to not use too much cause it would probably bother me to be around it for too long. Overall it isn't bad, I guess it just depends on someone's preference. I got this at a discount in return for my honest review.\", 'Nice quality but the cologne scent is not my favorite., I ordered the \\'Beast Blue Beard Oil with Organic Argan & Jojoba Oils, 1 fl oz\\' for review.<br />I love to try different beard oils. This one is a medium weight oil that initially smells very lightly scented. It\\'s a very \"cologne\" type scent which I really don\\'t care for. I am more into the woodsy, tea tree, sandalwood type scents. At first smell, this beard oil had a very light scent however once applied, this scent lasts a very long time. This is where I had a hard time with it. I like to put my beard oil on in the morning and night after brushing my teeth and I was still able to smell this beard oil into the next morning, which might have been a good thing had I enjoyed the scent. The beard oil itself as I said earlier, is a medium weight, and has a decent hold and is actually a nice overall beard oil but I ended up giving it to my son, as I personally didn\\'t like the scent at all.', 'Light smell, nice moisture, This is a nice creamy body wash, I use it for myself. It is very mild, but lathers nicely. The scent is very light, the bottle says lavender, but you can barely tell.', 'Good deodorant, ok scent, I chose a different scent this time for some variety but didn’t like it as much as others.<br />I do love this deodorant though. Goes on smooth, last a long time and my incredibly sensitive skin has no reaction to it!!', \"Love it!, Great smell and feel! This has to be my top favorite out most of the victoria's secret body mists it feels as well as smells really good some what like gummy bears.\"]}\u001b[0m\n",
